Introduction
------------

Cloud computing offers businesses a cost-effective, instantly scalable, and fault-tolerant IT infrastructure. AWS certifications have become a featured highlight in the global market.

*AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate (SOA-C01)* examination is intended for systems administrators in a systems operations role managing highly scalable and fault-tolerant systems in AWS. The certification demands that candidates demonstrate the ability to deploy AWS solutions for different scenarios according to AWS's best practices and troubleshoot AWS environments for performance. The AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate Certification requires its candidates to be comfortable deploying and managing full production operations on AWS.

Topics Covered
--------------

The important topics and concepts covered in the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate exam are:

-   **EBS**: EBS is a block-level storage device that you can attach to one instance or multiple instances at the same time. Knowledge of EBS is essential since it is used as a primary data storage that requires frequent updates. The Pluralsight course [Implementing Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-elastic-block-store-implementing/table-of-contents) provides fundamental knowledge about implementing EBS.

-   **IAM, IAM Policy, IAM User, IAM Group**: A basic understanding of policies and permissions is important to provide authorization to perform various tasks to secure infrastructure in AWS. The Pluralsight course [Identity and Access Management on AWS: Policies and Permissions](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/identity-access-management-aws-policies-permissions/table-of-contents) provides a thorough explanation of IAM policies and permissions.

-   **Autoscaling EC2**: EC2 is an Amazon service that allows developers to run apps in a secure cloud environment. The [Implementing AWS EC2 Auto Scaling](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-ec2-auto-scaling-implementing/description) course through Pluralsight provides key concepts about implementing and deploying EC2 autoscaling groups.

-   **ELB**: ELB automatically distributes incoming app traffic and scales resources. The [AWS Networking Deep Dive: Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-networking-deep-dive-elb/description) course through Pluralsight provides tips and tricks for configuring ELB.

-   **ElastiCache**: ElastiCache is a fully managed and scalable cache service provided by Amazon to improve the performance of the web apps. This [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) overview is a good read for basic understanding.

-   **Elastic Beanstalk**: Elastic Beanstalk is the orchestration service offered by Amazon Web Services for deploying apps. The [Building Applications Using Elastic Beanstalk](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/elastic-beanstalk-building-applications/table-of-contents) Pluralsight course helps you understand Elastic Beanstalk.

-   **VPC**: VPC allows you to create the logically isolated section of Amazon services in the virtual network. The Pluralsight courses [Deploying Basic Infrastructure Services on AWS](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-operations-deploying-basic-infrastructure/table-of-contents) and [AWS Networking Deep Dive: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-networking-deep-dive-vpc/table-of-contents) provide good knowledge about designing and implementing VPCs.

-   **RDS**: Amazon [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) is the relational database that provides a cost-effective and resizable capacity.

-   **ROUTE53**: Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System service. Understanding and configuring the DNS can be confusing for many developers. I highly recommend the course [AWS Networking Deep Dive: Route 53 DNS](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-networking-deep-dive-route-53-dns/table-of-contents) to learn about configuring Route53.

-   **OpsWork**: [OpsWork](https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/) is the configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet.

-   **SNS**: [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc) is the fully managed pub/sub messaging service.

-   **Snowball**: [Snowball](https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/) is a data migration and edge computing device.

-   **CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and Athena**: AWS monitoring and reporting is the most important topic on the exam. The [Architecting for Security on AWS](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/architecting-security-aws/table-of-contents) Pluralsight course provides knowledge about securing data, resources, and services at each level of deployment.

    -   **CloudWatch**: CloudWatch is a monitoring service in AWS and is used to configure alarms. The Pluralsight course [Monitoring AWS Cloud Security](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-cloud-security-monitoring/description) provides excellent knowledge about creating dashboards and monitoring AWS resources.

    -   **CloudTrail**: CloudTrail is the Amazon compliance service that enables governance and auditing of AWS accounts. The course [Monitoring with AWS CloudTrail](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/monitoring-aws-cloudtrail/table-of-contents) outlines the usage of CloudTrail and is useful for certification preparation.

    -   **Athena**: [AWS Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html) is a query service that uses ANSI-standard SQL to query directly from Amazon S3. This makes it easy to analyze big data instantly in S3 using standard SQL.

-   **CloudFormation**: AWS CloudFormation enables you to manage your complete infrastructure or AWS resources in a text file. The courses [Architecting for Operational Excellence on AWS](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/architecting-operational-excellence-aws/table-of-contents) and [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer: Continuous Delivery and Automation](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/continuous-delivery-automation-aws-certified-devops-engineer/table-of-contents) provide knowledge about automating infrastructure using CloudFormation.

-   **SQS**: [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) is a message queue service used by distributed apps to exchange messages through a polling model, and it can be used to decouple sending and receiving components.

-   **NAT Gateway**: [Network Address Translation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) (NAT) instances are used in a public subnet in the VPC. They enable instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the instances from receiving inbound traffic initiated by someone on the internet.

3.  **Unscored Content**: Your examination may include unscored items that are placed on the test to gather statistical information. These items are not identified on the form and do not affect your score.

**Note:** Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect.

### Time

You have 130 minutes to complete the exam.

### Cost

The cost of the certification is $150 USD.

### Delivery Method

The certification exam can be taken at a testing center or scheduled as an online proctored exam.

### Scoring

Test results are reported as a score between 100 and 1000. The minimum passing score for most sections is 75%. However, for a few sections, the minimum passing score is 68%. The overall minimum passing scoreis 720.

The score report contains a table the breaks down the candidate’s performance at each section level. This information is designed to provide general feedback for each section.
